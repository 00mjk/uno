# Building and Debugging Uno.UI

## Building Uno.UI

Using Visual Studio 2017 (15.5 or later):
* Open the [Uno.UI.sln](/src/Uno.UI.sln)
* Select the Uno.UI project
* Build

Inside Visual Studio, the number of platforms is restricted to limit the compilation time.

## Microsoft Source Link support
Uno.UI supports [SourceLink](https://github.com/dotnet/sourcelink/) and it now possible to
step into Uno.UI without downloading the repository.

Make sure **Enable source link support** check box is checked in **Tools** / **Options**
/ **Debugging** / **General** properties page. 

# Debugging Uno.UI

To debug Uno.UI inside of an existing project, the simplest way (until Microsoft provides a better way to avoid overriding the global cache) is to :
* Install a published `Uno.UI` package in a project you want to debug, taking note of the version number.
* Rename [crosstargeting_override.props.sample](/src/crosstargeting_override.props.sample) to `crosstargeting_override.props`
* Uncomment the `UnoNugetOverrideVersion` node
* Change the version number to the package you installed at the first step
* Build your solution.

> Note: This overrides your local nuget cache, making the cache inconstent with the binaries you just built. 
To ensure that the file you have in your cache a correct, either clear the cache, or observe the properties of the `Uno.UI.dll` file, where the
product version should contain a git CommitID.

Once Uno.UI built, open the files you want to debug inside the solution running the application you need to debug, and set breakpoints there.
