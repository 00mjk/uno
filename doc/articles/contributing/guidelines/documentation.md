# Guidelines for documentation

## information hiechary

fourish different categories of documentation:

- onboarding (getting started, developer environment and platform requirements, creating your first app - "hello world")
- conceptual theory (what is uno, mvvm, xaml, webassembly, platform specific knowledge)
- tutorials/task/activity docs (how to update between release v1 to v2 which unfortunately had breaking changes)
- reference docs (public api reference ie class members/what's implemented/per control information)


## building the documentation locally

tba. Any advice? It should be as simple as `make documentation` or `build.ps1 documentation`

## always update the table of content

If new documentation is created without adding it to the table of contents then CI will fail the build. See https://github.com/unoplatform/uno/pull/1221

## what parts of the UWP contract are currently implemented by Uno

See https://github.com/unoplatform/uno/blob/master/src/Uno.UWPSyncGenerator/DocGenerator.cs
